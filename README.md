#Command Line Chess

This project is a recreation of chess through command line. Moves can be made by inputting formal short or long algebraic chess notation.

To run the game, type the following commands. Note this game works best with VSCode terminal. Otherwise the ascii chess pieces may not load.

'''bash
make build
make play
'''

*To run tests:
make test

*Note that VSCode may highlight a lot of code as red in tests.ml but the tests
 still run.
